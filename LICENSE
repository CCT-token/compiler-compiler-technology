YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO USE CCTS.  IF YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS, EITHER BY CLICKING

This Agreement was last updated on November 11, 2015 and is effective between CCT and You as an individual  if You are 
licensing CCTS for Your own personal use, or between CCT and Your company or other legal entity for which You are accepting 
these Terms. The parties agree as follows:

1.	License.  
Upon Your acceptance of this Agreement and payment of Your initial Annual Development Subscription Fee of $360.00, 
CCT will make the CCTS source code available for You to download and use within the United States on a non-exclusive, 
non-transferable basis for Your internal software development purposes and to run Your software internally.  This is a 
single user license.  If You are seeking a multi-user license for Your enterprise, please contact CCT.

2.	Restrictions.  
None, except that You may only the CCTS source code under this Agreement in the United States for Your 
internal software development purposes and to run Your software internally for You or Your entity.  You may use the CCTS source 
code to develop as many software projects as You like, so long as Your use is internal to Your entity and You are a current 
subscriber of CCTS.  However, You may not disclose, transfer or distribute CCTS to any other users (even within Your entity,
as each user must enter into their own license), and if You want to commercialize Your software using CCTS (e.g., if You want
to use CCTS to benefit people or entities outside of Your entity or to market, distribute, license or sell software You create 
using CCTS to people or entities outside of Your entity), You must enter into a separate CCTS Production License Agreement with 
CCT to expand your license to permit  commercialization.  

3.	Annual Development Subscription Fee / Term.  
The license under this Agreement is an annual license and will expire on the day before the anniversary of Your payment of the 
Annual Development Subscription Fee.  To continue Your ability to use CCTS for Your development and internal use, You must agree to 
a new CCTS Development and Internal Use License each year and pay the corresponding Annual Development Subscription Fee.  If You provide 
credit card information to CCT, You authorize CCT to charge the credit card for CCTS, and You agree You will keep Your registration and 
credit card information updated.  The Annual Development Subscription Fee excludes any taxes, so if any taxes are due relating to You 
entering into this Agreement and using CCTS, You are responsible to pay them.

4.	Proprietary Software. CCTS and its source code and constituent parts and information, and CCT’s trademarks and logos, are the 
proprietary information and intellectual property of CCT and its licensors and are protected by trademark, copyright and patent rights, 
including US Patent No. 8,464,232 entitled ‘Compiler Compiler System with Syntax-Controlled Runtime and Binary Application Programming 
Interfaces’ (the “Patent”).  The license rights granted to you under this Agreement includes a license under such Patent as necessary 
for Your permitted use in accordance with this Agreement (but not for commercialization, which must be under a separate CCTS Production 
License with CCT).  This Agreement does not grant You or Your entity any ownership of the Patent, or trademark or copyright rights of CCT.  
However, as between You and CCT, any software you develop using CCTS will be owned by You (subject to CCT’s ownership of the CCTS code 
within your software program).  You agree that You will not disclose, disseminate or distribute any portion of CCTS or any of CCT’s 
trademarks since this Agreement is for an internal license only.  Any disclosure, dissemination or distribution would be addressed in a 
separate CCTS Production License.

5.	Termination.  If You breach this Agreement, CCT may terminate this Agreement upon notice to You, which may be to the e-mail 
address, fax number or other contact information You provided in Your registration materials.  Upon any termination or expiration of 
this  Agreement all rights granted to You terminate and You must cease using CCTS and delete any CCTS code integrated into Your software.  
If You do not comply with this, CCT may obtain injunctive relief, along with any other legal or equitable remedies available to it, 
without the need to post a bond. Sections 4 through 7 survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

6.	WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER.  CCT WARRANTS TO YOU THAT IT HAS THE RIGHT TO LICENSE CCTS TO YOU ON THE TERMS SET FORTH HEREIN.  
EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED IN THIS SECTION, CCTS IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  CCT DOES 
NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT CCTS IS FREE FROM ERROR, AND DOES NOT ASSUME, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS, ANY LIABILITY TO ANY ENTITY 
FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN CCTS, WHETHER SUCH ERRORS OR OMISSIONS RESULT FROM NEGLIGENCE, ACCIDENT OR 
OTHER CAUSE. CCT SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT DAMAGES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFIT OR REVENUE OR FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, EVEN IF CCT IS AWARE
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES.  YOU ARE RESPONSBLE FOR DETERMINING WHETHER CCTS IS SUITABLE FOR YOUR INTENDED USE 
AS WELL AS FOR YOUR USE OF CCTS, AND YOU WILL DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD CCT AND ITS LICENSORS HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIMS AGAINST 
THEM AND EXPENSES RELATING TO YOUR USE OF CCTS.  YOU ACKNOLWEDGE THAT YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS SECTION HAS MATERIALLY INDUCED CCT 
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND GRANT THE LICENSE HEREUNDER.  BECAUSE SOME STATES DON’T ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF 
LIABLITY FOR INDIRECT DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES, CCT’S LIABLITY IS LIMTIED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

7.	Miscellaneous. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between You and CCT pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and 
any and all prior written or oral agreements between You and CCT pertaining to the subject matter hereof are expressly cancelled. 
California law, without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions, governs this Agreement and the parties agree to submit to the 
sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within Orange County, California. The prevailing party in any action to enforce 
this Agreement is entitled to its costs and attorneys’ fees. If any of this Agreement’s provisions are held by a court or other tribunal 
of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, those provisions will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that 
this Agreement otherwise remains in full force and effect and enforceable. No waiver or modification of this Agreement will be binding 
upon either party unless made in a writing signed by both parties and no failure or delay in enforcing any right will be deemed a waiver.
